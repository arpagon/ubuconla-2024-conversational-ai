# Conversational AI on Ubuntu: Local Implementation with Vocode

## TL;DR

This repository contains the materials for the presentation "Conversational AI on Ubuntu: Local Implementation with Vocode" delivered at UbuConLA 2024. It includes the slides, code examples, and planning documents used to demonstrate how to set up and optimize a local conversational AI system on Ubuntu using Vocode.

## Talk Title

**Conversational AI on Ubuntu: Local Implementation with Vocode**

## Description

In this talk, we explore how to create a fully functional conversational AI on Ubuntu using Vocode. Attendees will learn how to install, configure, and deploy a local virtual assistant. The session covers the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) that run locally, as well as the implementation of Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies. Practical examples using the vocode-python library will be demonstrated, and tips for optimizing the performance and accuracy of your conversational AI will be shared.
